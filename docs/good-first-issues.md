# Good First Issues

Two lists here, kept deliberately separate so this page never implies
more exists than actually does:

1. **Already filed** — real, live issues on GitHub today, labeled
   `good first issue`, each with a full spec (problem, why it matters,
   relevant files, expected result, acceptance criteria, how to test).
   Pick one and comment before starting, per
   [`../CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
2. **Not yet filed** — realistic task ideas that aren't issues yet. If
   one interests you, open a Discussion or file it yourself using the
   [Good first issue template](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/good_first_issue.md)
   — don't assume it's claimed just because it's listed here.

## Not yet filed — candidate ideas

These map to realistic, low-friction contributions but don't exist as
issues yet. Worded to match what's actually true today — not every
plausible-sounding task is one this project can support as described:

1. **Add a new workflow example** under `examples/` — a real prompt +
   settings you ran, with honest results (see the
   [Workflow share](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/workflow_share.md)
   template).
2. **Improve the installation documentation** — `docs/INSTALL.md` is
   already thorough; the gap is usually a step that only becomes
   confusing in practice. Note it, or open a PR fixing it.
3. **Test GPU/hardware compatibility** — run the full pipeline on
   hardware not yet listed in `docs/HARDWARE.md` and file a
   [Hardware report](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/hardware_report.md).
   Real reports from real runs only — no speculative entries.
4. **Add a supported-model reference table** — a single doc page listing
   exactly which checkpoint filenames the code expects and where they
   come from (this partially exists in `docs/INSTALL.md`'s model table;
   a contribution here would mean expanding or cross-referencing it, not
   claiming new models are supported).
5. **Improve an error message** — pick one from `providers/` or
   `creative/` that's unclear when it fails, and make it name the actual
   problem (see issue #5 above for the Ollama-specific version already
   filed).
6. **Add a demo project** — a second `examples/` entry alongside
   `hero_demo/`, disclosed with the same honesty (see
   `examples/hero_demo/README.md` for the bar to match).
7. **Improve or add a translation** — `README_CN.md` exists; other
   languages don't yet. See the Documentation & Localization track in
   [`COMMUNITY_TRACKS.md`](COMMUNITY_TRACKS.md).
8. **Suggest a small UI improvement** — the Gradio interface in `app.py`
   is functional, not polished; a labeling, layout, or clarity fix is a
   real, scoped contribution.
9. **Add documentation screenshots** — the install guide and README
   describe the Gradio UI in text; real screenshots (redact any local
   paths first) would help a lot.
10. **Try an alternative Ollama-compatible LLM model** — the LLM
    provider is genuinely config-driven (`config.toml`'s `ollama_model`)
    — pull a different model, run the pipeline, and report what changed
    in a Discussion. (This is different from swapping the image/video
    model, which today only has one shipped implementation each — SDXL
    Lightning and LTX-Video — adding a second is Track D / Model
    Gateway work, not a first task.)
